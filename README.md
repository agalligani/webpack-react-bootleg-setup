# webpack-react-bootleg-setup

This template is a setup for using react-bootstrap along with a webpack setup including babel. 

Includes very basic routing, but if you want to use react-bootstrap you can start here and carefully use the code examples to build upon.

I hope it is useful to someone - certainly will be to me!
